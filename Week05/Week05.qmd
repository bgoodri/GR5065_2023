## Review of Last Week

$$
f\left(\theta \mid y, \dots\right) = \frac{f\left(\theta \bigcap y \mid \dots\right)}{f\left(\bcancel{\theta} \bigcap y \mid \dots\right)} =
\frac{f\left(\theta \mid \dots\right)f\left(y \mid \theta\right)}{\int_{-\infty}^\infty f\left(\theta \mid \dots \right)f\left(y \mid \theta\right) d\theta}
$$

-   For $\theta$ defined on a *continuous* parameter space, $\Theta$, the prior $f\left(\theta \mid \dots\right)$ and posterior $f\left(\theta \mid y, \dots\right)$ PDFS are different but both (should) integrate to $1$ over $\Theta$

-   The definite integral that defines the marginal PDF or PMF of $y$ under the model but irrespective of $\theta$ may not be doable:

    1.  It may not converge to a finite area

    2.  It usually entails an infinite number of terms

## Is Our Bayesians Learning?

-   GR5065 entails learning many new things that do not exactly build on other quantitative classes you have taken

-   The probability distribution of what you do not know given what you do know is of interest to anyone quantitative

-   Some QMSS students do not know R well enough to take GR5065, but they should know dplyr and ggplot2 regardless

-   GR5065 does arithmetic for discrete RVs & refers to calculus for continuous RVs, but infers everything using simulations

-   Need to be more engaged on Ed Discussion

## Three Tasks of Bayesian Inference

-   [Bayes Rules]{.underline} enumerates three tasks for Bayesian inference, which are elaborated on by Lancaster:

    1.  Estimation of Parameters

    2.  Evaluating Hypotheses

    3.  Prediction

-   Anti-Bayesian methods also involve these three tasks, but Bayesians do them in different and better ways

-   Lancaster adds a fourth, namely Making Decisions

## (1) Estimation of Parameters

1.  Analytically integrate to get the denominator of Bayes' Rule

    -   Only possible in a few [simple models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#Table_of_conjugate_distributions)

2.  Numerically integrate to get the denominator of Bayes' Rule

    -   Only feasible when there are very few parameters

3.  Draw from the joint distribution and keep realizations of the parameters iff the outcome realization matches the data

    -   Only possible with discrete outcomes

4.  Perform MCMC to draw from the posterior distribution

    -   Works for any posterior PDF that is differentiable w.r.t. $\theta$

## Example of Parameter Estimation

-   If the prior on $\theta$ is Beta with shape parameters $a$, and $b$ and the likelihood is binomial with successes $y$, size $n$, and success probability $\theta$, then the marginal(ized) probability is$\Pr\left(y \mid a, b, n\right) = f\left(\bcancel{\theta} \bigcap y \mid, a, b, n\right) = {n \choose y}\frac{B\left(a + y, b + n - y\right)}{B\left(a,b\right)}$

. . .

```{r}
a <- 0.700102; b <- 1; n <- 94; y <- 8
extraDistr::dbbinom(y, n, a, b) # analytical
joint <- function(theta) dbeta(theta, a, b) * dbinom(y, n, theta)
integrate(joint, lower = 0, upper = 1) # numerical
R <- 10^7
mean(8 == rbinom(R, n, prob = rbeta(R, a, b))) # simulation
```

## (2) Evaluating Hypotheses

-   Does *not* entail testing a point null hypothesis

-   Testing means evaluating $\Pr\left(\mbox{hypothesis} \mid \mbox{evidence}\right)$

-   FDA example: What are the prior and posterior probability that $\mbox{VE}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1 - 2\theta}{1 - \theta} \geq 0.3$?

. . .

```{r}
#| message: false
library(dplyr)
tibble(prior_theta = rbeta(R, a, b),
       posterior_theta = rbeta(R, a + y, b + n - y),
       prior_VE = (1 - 2 * prior_theta) / (1 - prior_theta),
       posterior_VE = (1 - 2 * posterior_theta) / 
         (1 - posterior_theta)) %>% 
  summarize(prior_prob = mean(prior_VE >= 0.3),
            posterior_prob = mean(posterior_VE >= 0.3))
```

## Testing Point Null Hypotheses

-   Frequentists cannot --- because $\theta$ and $\mbox{VE}\left(\theta\right)$ are not random variables --- ask questions like "What is $\Pr\left(\mbox{VE}\left(\theta\right) \leq 0.3 \mid n, y\right)$?" So, instead they ask questions like "What is $\Pr\left(\widehat{\theta} \leq \frac{8}{n} \mid \mbox{VE}\left(\theta\right) = 0.3\right)$?" because $\widehat{\theta} = \frac{y}{n}$ is a random variable that takes different values each time $n$ people in a trial get covid, which can be simulated as:

```{r}
# If theta = (1 - VE) / (2 - VE), what is the implication of VE = 0.3?
tibble(y = rbinom(R, size = n, prob = (1 - 0.3) / (2 - 0.3)),
       theta_hat = y / n) %>% # maximum likelihood estimator of theta
  summarize(p_value = mean(theta_hat <= 8 / n))
```

## Confidence Intervals

-   Some people say that using $p$-values to test a null hypothesis is bad but confidence intervals are good, despite the fact that a confidence interval is a range of values such that if the null hypothesis value, $\theta_0$, were anywhere in that interval, you would fail to reject the null hypothesis

-   A confidence interval is a line segment but people insist on ascribing a (Bayesian) topology to it such that values in the middle are more probable than values near the endpoints

-   The FDA's rule that the 95% confidence interval for $\mbox{VE}\left(\theta\right)$ must exclude $0.3$ merely implies that 2.5% of vaccines whose effectiveness is $0.3$ will get approved

## Neyman on Confidence Intervals

-   Jerzy Neyman, who invented the confidence interval, [said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Common_misunderstandings)

> I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will tend to $\alpha$ \[1 minus the type I error rate\]. Consider now the case when a sample is already drawn, and the calculations have given \[particular limits\]. Can we say that in this particular case the probability of the true value \[falling between these limits\] is equal to $\alpha$? The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter is an unknown constant, and no probability statement concerning its value may be made \dots"

## (3) Prediction

-   Prediction is just the outcome margin of the joint distribution between the parameter(s) and outcome(s)

-   You can use either prior or posterior parameter draws

. . .

```{r}
tibble(prior_theta = rbeta(R, a, b),
       posterior_theta = rbeta(R, a + y, b + n - y),
       prior_pred = rbinom(R, size = n, prob = prior_theta),
       posterior_pred = rbinom(R, size = n, prob = posterior_theta)) %>% 
  summarize(prob = mean(posterior_pred < prior_pred))
```

-   Others use "prediction" to mean "point prediction from $\widehat{\theta}$", rather than from the distribution induced by $\theta \mid a, b, n, y$

## And That's What It's All About

-   What is the distribution of a *future* $y_{N + 1}$ given *past* realizations, $y_1, \dots, y_N$? Do the Bayesian hokey pokey, $f\left(y_{N + 1} \mid y_1, \dots, y_N\right) = f\left(y_{N + 1} \bigcap \bcancel{\theta} \mid y_1, \dots, y_N\right) =$ $\int_\Theta f\left(y_{N + 1} \mid \theta\right) f\left(\theta \mid y_1, \dots, y_N\right) d\theta$

-   In the case of the BioNTech vaccine, this would result in

```{r}
extraDistr::dbbinom(1, size = 1, a + y, b + n - y)
```

. . .

-   Supervised learners eschew probabilistic thinking by reasoning $\widehat{\theta} = \frac{y}{n}$ and $\Pr\left(y_{N + 1} \mid \widehat{\theta}\right) = \widehat{\theta} < \frac{1}{2}$ so $y_{N + 1}$ is *classified* as $0$ deterministically but might be a false negative

## Gamma Distribution

-   If $\Omega = \mathbb{R}_+$ and $a, b > 0$, the PDF of a Gamma R.V., $X$, is $$f\left(x \mid a,b\right) = \frac{b^a}{\Gamma\left(a\right)}x^{a - 1}e^{-bx},$$ where $\Gamma\left(a\right) = \int_0^\infty t^{a - 1} e^{-t}dt = \frac{1}{a} \prod\limits_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{1 + \frac{a}{n}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^a$ simplifies to $\left(a - 1\right)!$ iff $a$ is a positive integer
-   If $a = 1$, the Gamma PDF simplifies to that of an exponential with rate $b$ (i.e. with expectation $1 / b$)
-   $\mu = \frac{a}{b}$ and $\sigma^2 = \frac{a}{b^2}$ so you can let $a = \frac{\mu^2}{\sigma^2}$ and $b = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2}$

## Negative Binomial Distribution

-   Suppose $X$ is distributed Poisson with expectation $\mu$ and that $\mu$ has a Gamma prior with shape $a > 0$ and rate $b > 0$

-   The marginal(ized) distribution of $X$ is confusingly called negative binomial and has the (prior predictive) PMF $$\Pr\left(x \mid a,b\right) = f\left(\bcancel{\mu} \bigcap x \mid a,b\right) = \\ \int_0^\infty \frac{b^a}{\Gamma\left(a\right)}\mu^{a - 1}e^{-b\mu} \times \frac{1}{x!} \mu^x e^{-\mu} d\mu = \\
    \frac{b^a}{\Gamma\left(a\right)} \frac{1}{x!} \int_0^\infty \mu^{a + x - 1}e^{-\left(b + 1\right)\mu} d\mu = \frac{b^a}{\Gamma\left(a\right)} \frac{1}{x!} \frac{\Gamma\left(a + x\right)}{\left(b + 1\right)^{a + x}}$$

## Posterior Distribution of $\mu$ {.smaller}

-   Suppose you observe realized counts $x_1, \dots, x_N$ that are presumed conditionally independent with expectation $\mu$. Under the Gamma prior for $\mu$, the posterior PDF is $$f\left(\mu \mid a,b, x_1, \dots x_N\right) = \frac{f\left(\mu \mid a,b\right)\prod_{n = 1}^N\Pr\left(x_n \mid \mu\right)}{\prod_{n = 1}^N\Pr\left(x_n \mid a,b\right)}$$

-   Note: $\prod\limits_{n = 1}^N \Pr\left(x_n \mid \mu\right) = \prod\limits_{n = 1}^N \frac{\mu^{x_n} e^{-\mu}}{x_n!} = e^{-N\mu} \mu^{\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N x_n}\prod\limits_{n = 1}^N \frac{1}{x_n!}$. Let $s = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^N x_n$ be distributed Poisson with expectation $N\mu$. Then, $$f\left(\mu \mid a,b,s\right) \propto \mu^{a - 1} e^{-b \mu} \mu^s e^{-N\mu} = \mu^{a^\ast - 1} e^{-b^\ast \mu},$$

    which is proportional to a Gamma PDF with shape $a^\ast = a + s$ and rate $b^\ast = b + N$.

-   Posterior predictive distribution is negative binomial with $a^\ast$ and $b^\ast$ rather than $a$ and $b$

## Simulation

```{r}
N <- 5
a <- 1.6
b <- 0.8
R <- 1e6
joint <- function(mu, s = 20) dgamma(mu, a, b) * dpois(s, N * mu)
tibble(mu = rgamma(R, a, b)) %>%
  rowwise %>% 
  mutate(s = sum(rpois(N, mu))) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  filter(s == 20) %>% # suppose you observed an s of 20
  summarize(average = mean(mu), 
            expectation = (a + first(s)) / (b + N),
            marginal = n() / R,
            numerical = integrate(joint, lower = 0, upper = Inf)$value,
            x_next = rnbinom(1, a + first(s), (b + N) / (b + N + 1)))
```

## Principles to Choose Priors With

1.  Do not use improper priors (those that do not integrate to $1$)
2.  Subjective, including "weakly informative" priors
3.  Entropy Maximization
4.  Invariance to reparameterization (particularly scaling)
5.  "Objective" (actually also subjective, but different from 2)

-   Choose a prior family that integrates to $1$ over $\Theta$. Then, choose hyperparameters that are consistent w/ your beliefs.
-   The important part of a prior is what values it discounts. Draw from the prior predictive distribution to check.

## *Ex Ante* P{D,M}F of *Ex Post* Data {.smaller}

A likelihood function is the same expression as a P{D,M}F with 3 distinctions:

1.  For the PDF or PMF, $f\left(\left.x\right|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)$, we think of $X$ as a random variable and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as given, whereas we conceive of the likelihood function, $\mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};x\right)$, to be a function of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ (in the mathematical sense) evaluated only at the *observed* data, $x$
    -   As a consequence, $\int\limits _{-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(\left.x\right|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)dx=1$ or $\sum\limits _{x \in\Omega}f\left(\left.x\right|\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)=1$ while $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\cdots\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};x\right)d\theta_{1}d\theta_{2}\ldots d\theta_{K}$ may not exist and is never 1
2.  We often think of "the likelihood function" for $N$ conditionally independent observations, so $\mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};\mathbf{x}\right)=\prod _{n=1}^{N}\mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};x_n\right)$
3.  By "the likelihood function", we often really mean the natural logarithm thereof, a.k.a. the log-likelihood function $\ell\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};\mathbf{x}\right) = \ln\mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta},\mathbf{x}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{N} \ln\mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta};x_n\right)$

-   Bayesians (can) use the same log-likelihood functions as Frequentists

## Normal Illustration

$$
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}
$$

-   For a given $\mu$ and $\sigma > 0$, the above PDF (of $x$) integrates to $1$ over $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$

```{r}
integrate(dnorm, lower = -Inf, upper = Inf, mean = 1, sd = 2)
```

-   For a given $x$ and $\mu$, the integral over $\Theta =\mathbb{R}_+$ of the above likelihood function (of $\sigma$) diverges

```{r}
integrate(dnorm, lower = 0, upper = Inf, x = 5 / 4, mean = 1, 
          subdivisions = 10^4, stop.on.error = FALSE)
```

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

-   Frequentists do not allow a prior on $\theta$, which is not a R.V.

-   If there is no $f\left(\theta\right)$, there is no $f\left(\theta \bigcap y\right) = f\left(\theta\right) f\left(y \mid \theta\right)$, $f\left(\bcancel{\theta} \bigcap y\right) = \int_\Theta f\left(\theta \bigcap y\right) d\theta$, or $f\left(\theta \mid y\right) = \frac{f\left(\theta \bigcap y\right)}{f\left(\bcancel{\theta} \bigcap y\right)}$

-   Frequentists do allow conditioning on $\theta$ or considering how the probability (density) of $y$ changes as a function of $\theta$

-   Since $\ln$ is a monotonic transformation, the $\widehat{\theta}$ that maximizes $L\left(\widehat{\theta}; y\right)$ also maximizes $\ln L\left(\widehat{\theta};y\right)$, which is more amenable to numerical maximization
